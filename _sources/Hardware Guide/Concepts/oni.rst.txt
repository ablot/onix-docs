ONI vs. ONIX 
==========================================
`Open Neuro Interface <https://github.com/open-ephys/ONI>`__ is a hardware and
API specification designed to meet the needs of experimental neuroscientists.
ONIX hardware and `liboni <https://github.com/open-ephys/liboni>`__ are
implementations of the ONI specification. Some ONI concepts are useful for
understanding how to effectively use the ONIX system, so they are presented
here in a simplified form.
