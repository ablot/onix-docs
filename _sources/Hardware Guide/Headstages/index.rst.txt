.. note:: We hope that there will be community additions to this list. Implementing your
    own headstage that incorporates other sensors (e.g cameras, temperature,
    etc), or even custom ASICs (e.g. next gen ephys probes) and have automatic
    integration with existing ONIX headstages and hardware can be quite simple.
    If you're interested in creating a custom headstage that works with
    existing ONIX hardware and software, please get in touch using the links on
    the :ref:`support` page.
