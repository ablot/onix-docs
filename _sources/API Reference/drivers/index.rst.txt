Hardware Driver Translators
#######################################
There are a many existing `device drivers
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver>`_ that support hardware for data
acquisition. Some of these drivers can be used as a backend for ONI-compliant
APIs if they provide some means to support the required ONI communication
channels. Have a look at the `ONI Spec <https://github.com/open-ephys/ONI>`_
for specifications of these channels.

An ONI hardware driver translator implements `onidriver.h
<https://github.com/open-ephys/liboni/blob/main/api/liboni/onidriver.h>`_ to
convert routines in existing, potentially proprietary, device drivers (and
corresponding hardware) into a user space library that can be consumed by
ONI-compliant APIs. These are loaded by the ONI-compliant API at runtime and
therefore are separate form the API both in terms of development and licensing
requirements. The API's agnosticism to hardware means it can be use for both
open and proprietary third party hardware.

ONIX hardware driver translator implementations are documented here. Have a
look at the following links for more information on each. :ref:`Get in touch
<support>` if you want to write a driver translator to give your hardware
automatic access to our API and software.
